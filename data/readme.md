## Data

Raw survey data about Thanksgiving Dinner is from FiveThirtyEight, pulled directly from the [TidyTuesday repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-20).

The 'thanksgiving_pie.csv' file is a wrangled subset of the raw data, with added survey responses from our R-Ladies community. The wrangling script, pie_data_wrangling.R, is located in the main folder of this repo.
